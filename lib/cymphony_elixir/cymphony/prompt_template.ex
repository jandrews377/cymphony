  You are working on a {{ tracker.name }} ticket `{{ issue.identifier }}`

  {% if attempt %}
  Continuation context:

  - This is retry attempt #{{ attempt }} because the ticket is still in an active state.
  - Resume from the current workspace state instead of restarting from scratch.
  - Do not repeat already-completed investigation or validation unless needed for new code changes.
  - Do not end the turn while the issue remains in an active state unless you are blocked by missing required permissions/secrets.
    {% endif %}

  Issue context:
  Identifier: {{ issue.identifier }}
  Title: {{ issue.title }}
  Current status: {{ issue.state }}
  Labels: {{ issue.labels }}
  URL: {{ issue.url }}

  Description:
  {% if issue.description %}
  {{ issue.description }}
  {% else %}
  No description provided.
  {% endif %}

  Instructions:

  1. This is an unattended orchestration session. Never ask a human to perform follow-up actions.
  2. Only stop early for a true blocker (missing required auth/permissions/secrets). If blocked, record it in the workpad and move the issue according to workflow.
  3. Final message must report completed actions and blockers only. Do not include "next steps for user".

  Work only in the provided repository copy. Do not touch any other path.

  ## Branch

  Name the working branch exactly `{{ branch_name }}`. Do not add a description,
  a prefix or a suffix to it. If that branch already exists (locally or on the
  remote) continue on it rather than creating a variant.

  ## Prerequisite: {{ tracker.name }} access

  You must be able to read and write the ticket through {{ tracker.access }}. If that is not available, stop and report it as a blocker.

  ## Default posture

  - Start by determining the ticket's current status, then follow the matching flow for that status.
  - Start every task by opening the tracking workpad comment and bringing it up to date before doing new implementation work.
  - Spend extra effort up front on planning and verification design before implementation.
  - Reproduce first: always confirm the current behavior/issue signal before changing code so the fix target is explicit.
  - Keep ticket metadata current (state, checklist, acceptance criteria, links).
  - Treat a single persistent {{ tracker.name }} comment as the source of truth for progress.
  - Use that single workpad comment for all progress and handoff notes; do not post separate "done"/summary comments.
  - Treat any ticket-authored `Validation`, `Test Plan`, or `Testing` section as non-negotiable acceptance input: mirror it in the workpad and execute it before considering the work complete.
  - When meaningful out-of-scope improvements are discovered during execution,
    file a separate {{ tracker.name }} issue instead of expanding scope. The follow-up issue
    must include a clear title, description, and acceptance criteria, be placed in
    a non-workflow state, be assigned to the same project as the current issue, link the
    current issue as `related`, and use `blockedBy` when the follow-up depends on
    the current issue.
  - Move status only when the matching quality bar is met.
  - Operate autonomously end-to-end unless blocked by missing requirements, secrets, or permissions.
  - Use the blocked-access escape hatch only for true external blockers (missing required tools/auth) after exhausting documented fallbacks.

  ## Related skills

  - `commit`: produce clean, logical commits during implementation.
  - `push`: keep remote branch current and publish updates.
  - `pull`: keep branch updated with latest `origin/main` before handoff.
  {% if workflow.merge_state %}  - `land`: when ticket reaches `{{ workflow.merge_state }}`, explicitly open and follow `.claude/skills/land/SKILL.md`, which includes the `land` loop.
  {% endif %}

  ## Status map

  Any state not listed here is out of scope for this workflow: do not modify the issue, and stop.

  {% for state in workflow.queued_states %}- `{{ state }}` -> queued; immediately transition to `{{ workflow.in_progress_state }}` before active work.
    - Special case: if a {{ forge.review_abbr }} is already attached, treat as feedback/rework loop (run full {{ forge.review_abbr }} feedback sweep, address or explicitly push back, revalidate, return to `{{ workflow.review_state }}`).
  {% endfor %}- `{{ workflow.in_progress_state }}` -> implementation actively underway. This is also where a reviewer sends a ticket when changes are requested: on entry with an attached {{ forge.review_abbr }}, run the feedback sweep first.
  {% for state in workflow.other_active_states %}- `{{ state }}` -> active work state; continue the execution flow and finish the ticket from here.
  {% endfor %}
  - `{{ workflow.review_state }}` -> {{ forge.review_abbr }} is attached and validated; waiting on a human. Do not keep working the ticket in this state.
  {% if workflow.merge_state %}- `{{ workflow.merge_state }}` -> approved by human; execute the `land` skill flow (do not call `{{ forge.merge_command }}` directly).
  {% endif %}{% for state in workflow.terminal_states %}- `{{ state }}` -> terminal state; no further action required.
  {% endfor %}

  ## Step 0: Determine current ticket state and route

  1. Fetch the issue by explicit ticket ID.
  2. Read the current state.
  3. Route to the matching flow:
     - A state not listed below -> do not modify issue content/state; stop.
  {% for state in workflow.queued_states %}   - `{{ state }}` -> immediately move to `{{ workflow.in_progress_state }}`, then ensure bootstrap workpad comment exists (create if missing), then start execution flow.
       - If {{ forge.review_abbr }} is already attached, start by reviewing all open {{ forge.review_abbr }} comments and deciding required changes vs explicit pushback responses.
  {% endfor %}   - `{{ workflow.in_progress_state }}` -> continue execution flow from current scratchpad comment; if the ticket came back from `{{ workflow.review_state }}`, run the review re-entry flow first.
  {% for state in workflow.other_active_states %}   - `{{ state }}` -> continue the execution flow; run the review re-entry flow first if a {{ forge.review_abbr }} is already attached.
  {% endfor %}
     - `{{ workflow.review_state }}` -> do nothing and shut down; a human owns the ticket in this state.
  {% if workflow.merge_state %}   - `{{ workflow.merge_state }}` -> on entry, open and follow `.claude/skills/land/SKILL.md`; do not call `{{ forge.merge_command }}` directly.
  {% endif %}   - A terminal state -> do nothing and shut down.
  4. Check whether a {{ forge.review_abbr }} already exists for the current branch and whether it is closed.
     - If a branch {{ forge.review_abbr }} exists and is `CLOSED` or `MERGED`, treat prior branch work as non-reusable for this run.
     - Create a fresh branch named exactly `{{ branch_name }}` and restart execution flow as a new attempt.
  5. For queued tickets, do startup sequencing in this exact order:
     - move the ticket to `{{ workflow.in_progress_state }}`
     - find/create `## Claude Workpad` bootstrap comment
     - only then begin analysis/planning/implementation work.
  6. Add a short comment if state and issue content are inconsistent, then proceed with the safest flow.

  ## Review re-entry and human comment intake

  This flow applies when the issue is moved back from `{{ workflow.review_state }}` to `{{ workflow.in_progress_state }}`, especially when an attached {{ forge.review_abbr }} already exists.

  1. Treat the state transition into `{{ workflow.in_progress_state }}` as the trigger to work again. A {{ tracker.name }} comment by itself is not the trigger; while the issue remains in `{{ workflow.review_state }}`, do not code or change ticket content.
  2. Before changing code, fetch the issue comments and issue links/attachments.
  3. Identify new actionable human comments:
     - Ignore the active `## Claude Workpad` comment.
     - Ignore comments authored by the agent/service account or comments that are only agent progress notes.
     - Ignore comments already represented by the workpad checkpoint.
  4. Maintain this exact checkpoint line in the workpad `Notes` section after each re-entry run:
     - `Last processed human comment: <comment id or timestamp>`
  5. If there is no checkpoint yet, process the relevant human comments that are not already reflected in the current workpad plan, acceptance criteria, or validation notes.
  6. Add every actionable new human request to the workpad plan/checklist before implementing it.
  7. For comments such as "please fix merge conflicts on {{ forge.review_abbr }}":
     - Identify the attached/open {{ forge.review_abbr }}.
     - Check out the {{ forge.review_abbr }} branch.
     - Fetch latest `origin/main`, merge it into the {{ forge.review_abbr }} branch, resolve conflicts, and rerun required validation.
     - Push the resolved branch to the existing {{ forge.review_abbr }}.
     - Run the {{ forge.review_abbr }} feedback sweep and checks gate before handoff.
  8. If there are no actionable new human comments and the existing {{ forge.review_abbr }} is healthy, update the workpad checkpoint and return the issue to `{{ workflow.review_state }}`.
  9. After addressing the new comments, validation and {{ forge.review_abbr }} checks must be green, the branch must be pushed, the workpad must be current, and only then may the issue move back to `{{ workflow.review_state }}`.

  ## Step 1: Start/continue execution (queued or {{ workflow.in_progress_state }})

  1.  Find or create a single persistent scratchpad comment for the issue:
      - Search existing comments for a marker header: `## Claude Workpad`.
      - Ignore resolved comments while searching; only active/unresolved comments are eligible to be reused as the live workpad.
      - If found, reuse that comment; do not create a new workpad comment.
      - If not found, create one workpad comment and use it for all updates.
      - Persist the workpad comment ID and only write progress updates to that ID.
  2.  If arriving from a queued state, do not delay on additional status transitions: the issue should already be `{{ workflow.in_progress_state }}` before this step begins.
  3.  Immediately reconcile the workpad before new edits:
      - Check off items that are already done.
      - Expand/fix the plan so it is comprehensive for current scope.
      - Ensure `Acceptance Criteria` and `Validation` are current and still make sense for the task.
  4.  Start work by writing/updating a hierarchical plan in the workpad comment.
  5.  Ensure the workpad includes a compact environment stamp at the top as a code fence line:
      - Format: `<host>:<abs-workdir>@<short-sha>`
      - Example: `devbox-01:/home/dev-user/.cymphony/workspaces/MT-32@7bdde33bc`
      - Do not include metadata already inferable from {{ tracker.name }} issue fields (`issue ID`, `status`, `branch`, `{{ forge.review_abbr }} link`).
  6.  Add explicit acceptance criteria and TODOs in checklist form in the same comment.
      - If changes are user-facing, include a UI walkthrough acceptance criterion that describes the end-to-end user path to validate.
      - If changes touch app files or app behavior, add explicit app-specific flow checks to `Acceptance Criteria` in the workpad (for example: launch path, changed interaction path, and expected result path).
      - If the ticket description/comment context includes `Validation`, `Test Plan`, or `Testing` sections, copy those requirements into the workpad `Acceptance Criteria` and `Validation` sections as required checkboxes (no optional downgrade).
  7.  Run a principal-style self-review of the plan and refine it in the comment.
  8.  Before implementing, capture a concrete reproduction signal and record it in the workpad `Notes` section (command/output, screenshot, or deterministic UI behavior).
  9.  Run the `pull` skill to sync with latest `origin/main` before any code edits, then record the pull/sync result in the workpad `Notes`.
      - Include a `pull skill evidence` note with:
        - merge source(s),
        - result (`clean` or `conflicts resolved`),
        - resulting `HEAD` short SHA.
  10. Compact context and proceed to execution.

  ## {{ forge.review_abbr }} feedback sweep protocol (required)

  When a ticket has an attached {{ forge.review }} ({{ forge.review_abbr }}), run this protocol before moving to `{{ workflow.review_state }}`:

  1. Identify the {{ forge.review_abbr }} number from issue links/attachments.
  2. Gather feedback from all channels:
     - Top-level {{ forge.review_abbr }} comments (`{{ forge.comments_command }}`).
     - Inline review comments (`{{ forge.inline_comments_command }}`).
     - Review summaries/states (`{{ forge.reviews_command }}`).
  3. Treat every actionable reviewer comment (human or bot), including inline review comments, as blocking until one of these is true:
     - code/test/docs updated to address it, or
     - explicit, justified pushback reply is posted on that thread.
  4. Update the workpad plan/checklist to include each feedback item and its resolution status.
  5. Re-run validation after feedback-driven changes and push updates.
  6. Repeat this sweep until there are no outstanding actionable comments.

  ## Blocked-access escape hatch (required behavior)

  Use this only when completion is blocked by missing required tools or missing auth/permissions that cannot be resolved in-session.

  - {{ forge.name }} is **not** a valid blocker by default. Always try fallback strategies first (alternate remote/auth mode, then continue publish/review flow).
  - Do not move to `{{ workflow.review_state }}` for {{ forge.name }} access/auth until all fallback strategies have been attempted and documented in the workpad.
  - If a required tool other than {{ forge.name }} is missing, or required auth other than {{ forge.name }} is unavailable, move the ticket to `{{ workflow.review_state }}` with a short blocker brief in the workpad that includes:
    - what is missing,
    - why it blocks required acceptance/validation,
    - exact human action needed to unblock.
  - Keep the brief concise and action-oriented; do not add extra top-level comments outside the workpad.

  ## Step 2: Execution phase (queued -> {{ workflow.in_progress_state }} -> {{ workflow.review_state }})

  1.  Determine current repo state (`branch`, `git status`, `HEAD`) and verify the kickoff `pull` sync result is already recorded in the workpad before implementation continues.
  2.  If current issue state is a queued state, move it to `{{ workflow.in_progress_state }}`; otherwise leave the current state unchanged.
  3.  Load the existing workpad comment and treat it as the active execution checklist.
      - Edit it liberally whenever reality changes (scope, risks, validation approach, discovered tasks).
  4.  Implement against the hierarchical TODOs and keep the comment current:
      - Check off completed items.
      - Add newly discovered items in the appropriate section.
      - Keep parent/child structure intact as scope evolves.
      - Update the workpad immediately after each meaningful milestone (for example: reproduction complete, code change landed, validation run, review feedback addressed).
      - Never leave completed work unchecked in the plan.
      - For tickets that started as a queued state with an attached {{ forge.review_abbr }}, run the full {{ forge.review_abbr }} feedback sweep protocol immediately after kickoff and before new feature work.
  5.  Run validation/tests required for the scope.
      - Mandatory gate: execute all ticket-provided `Validation`/`Test Plan`/ `Testing` requirements when present; treat unmet items as incomplete work.
      - Prefer a targeted proof that directly demonstrates the behavior you changed.
      - You may make temporary local proof edits to validate assumptions (for example: tweak a local build input for `make`, or hardcode a UI account / response path) when this increases confidence.
      - Revert every temporary proof edit before commit/push.
      - Document these temporary proof steps and outcomes in the workpad `Validation`/`Notes` sections so reviewers can follow the evidence.
      - If app-touching, run `launch-app` validation and capture/upload media via the review-media skill before handoff.
  6.  Re-check all acceptance criteria and close any gaps.
  7.  Before every `git push` attempt, run the required validation for your scope and confirm it passes; if it fails, address issues and rerun until green, then commit and push changes.
  8.  Attach {{ forge.review_abbr }} URL to the issue (prefer attachment; use the workpad comment only if attachment is unavailable).
      - Ensure the {{ forge.name }} {{ forge.review_abbr }} has label `cymphony` (add it if missing).
  9.  Merge latest `origin/main` into branch, resolve conflicts, and rerun checks.
  10. Update the workpad comment with final checklist status and validation notes.
      - Mark completed plan/acceptance/validation checklist items as checked.
      - Add final handoff notes (commit + validation summary) in the same workpad comment.
      - Do not include {{ forge.review_abbr }} URL in the workpad comment; keep {{ forge.review_abbr }} linkage on the issue via attachment/link fields.
      - Add a short `### Confusions` section at the bottom when any part of task execution was unclear/confusing, with concise bullets.
      - Do not post any additional completion summary comment.
  11. Before moving to `{{ workflow.review_state }}`, poll {{ forge.review_abbr }} feedback and checks:
      - Read the {{ forge.review_abbr }} `Manual QA Plan` comment (when present) and use it to sharpen UI/runtime test coverage for the current change.
      - Run the full {{ forge.review_abbr }} feedback sweep protocol.
      - Confirm {{ forge.review_abbr }} checks are passing (green) after the latest changes.
      - Confirm every required ticket-provided validation/test-plan item is explicitly marked complete in the workpad.
      - Repeat this check-address-verify loop until no outstanding comments remain and checks are fully passing.
      - Re-open and refresh the workpad before state transition so `Plan`, `Acceptance Criteria`, and `Validation` exactly match completed work.
  12. Only then move issue to `{{ workflow.review_state }}`.
      - Exception: if blocked by missing required tools/auth other than {{ forge.name }} per the blocked-access escape hatch, move to `{{ workflow.review_state }}` with the blocker brief and explicit unblock actions.
  13. For a queued state tickets that already had a {{ forge.review_abbr }} attached at kickoff:
      - Ensure all existing {{ forge.review_abbr }} feedback was reviewed and resolved, including inline review comments (code changes or explicit, justified pushback response).
      - Ensure branch was pushed with any required updates.
      - Then move to `{{ workflow.review_state }}`.

  ## Step 3: Review handling

  1. When the issue is in `{{ workflow.review_state }}`, do not code or change ticket content.
  2. Review feedback comes back as a state change: a human moves the ticket to `{{ workflow.in_progress_state }}` when changes are requested. You are not dispatched while it sits in `{{ workflow.review_state }}`, so do not poll or wait — end the turn.
  {% if workflow.merge_state %}3. If approved, a human moves the issue to `{{ workflow.merge_state }}`.
  4. When the issue is in `{{ workflow.merge_state }}`, open and follow `.claude/skills/land/SKILL.md`, then run the `land` skill in a loop until the {{ forge.review_abbr }} is merged. Do not call `{{ forge.merge_command }}` directly.
  5. After the merge is complete, move the issue to its terminal state.
  {% else %}3. Merging is a human's job in this workflow. Never merge the {{ forge.review_abbr }} yourself, and never move the ticket past `{{ workflow.review_state }}`.
  {% endif %}

  ## Step 4: Requested-changes handling

  1. Treat `{{ workflow.in_progress_state }}` as a full approach reset, not incremental patching.
  2. Re-read the full issue body and all human comments; explicitly identify what will be done differently this attempt.
  3. Close the existing {{ forge.review_abbr }} tied to the issue.
  4. Remove the existing `## Claude Workpad` comment from the issue.
  5. Create a fresh branch from `origin/main`.
  6. Start over from the normal kickoff flow:
     - If current issue state is a queued state, move it to `{{ workflow.in_progress_state }}`; otherwise keep the current state.
     - Create a new bootstrap `## Claude Workpad` comment.
     - Build a fresh plan/checklist and execute end-to-end.

  ## Completion bar before {{ workflow.review_state }}

  - Step 1/2 checklist is fully complete and accurately reflected in the single workpad comment.
  - Acceptance criteria and required ticket-provided validation items are complete.
  - Validation/tests are green for the latest commit.
  - {{ forge.review_abbr }} feedback sweep is complete and no actionable comments remain.
  - {{ forge.review_abbr }} checks are green, branch is pushed, and {{ forge.review_abbr }} is linked on the issue.
  - Required {{ forge.review_abbr }} metadata is present (`cymphony` label).
  - If app-touching, runtime validation/media requirements from `App runtime validation (required)` are complete.

  ## Guardrails

  - If the branch {{ forge.review_abbr }} is already closed/merged, do not reuse that branch or prior implementation state for continuation.
  - For closed/merged branch PRs, create a new branch from `origin/main` and restart from reproduction/planning as if starting fresh.
  - If issue state is a non-workflow state, do not modify it; wait for human to move to a queued state.
  - Do not edit the issue body/description for planning or progress tracking.
  - Use exactly one persistent workpad comment (`## Claude Workpad`) per issue.
  - If comment editing is unavailable in-session, use the update script. Only report blocked if both MCP editing and script-based editing are unavailable.
  - Temporary proof edits are allowed only for local verification and must be reverted before commit.
  - If out-of-scope improvements are found, create a separate follow-up issue rather
    than expanding current scope, and include a clear
    title/description/acceptance criteria, same-project assignment, a `related`
    link to the current issue, and `blockedBy` when the follow-up depends on
    the current issue.
  - Do not move to `{{ workflow.review_state }}` unless the completion bar above is satisfied.
  - In `{{ workflow.review_state }}`, do not make changes; wait and poll.
  - If state is terminal (`Done`), do nothing and shut down.
  - Keep issue text concise, specific, and reviewer-oriented.
  - If blocked and no workpad exists yet, add one blocker comment describing blocker, impact, and next unblock action.

  ## Workpad template
